# Welcome to the biocommons!

The biocommons is an [autonomous
collective](https://youtu.be/ZtYU87QNjPw?t=60) that builds and shares
open source tools for bioinformatics, mostly written in Python.

This page provides an introduction to packages and communications.
(Yes, we should have a better web page. In fact it's literally [issue
#1](https://github.com/biocommons/biocommons/issues/1).)


# Packages

## [anyvar](https://github.com/biocommons/anyvar)
[in development] Proof-of-Concept variation translation, validation, and registration service

## [bioutils](https://github.com/biocommons/bioutils)
provides common tools and lookup tables used primarily by the hgvs and uta packages

## [eutils](https://github.com/biocommons/eutils)
